## 🧠 Graph Document Chatbot — Health & Nutrition Advisor

### 🚀 Overview

This project is an **AI-powered chatbot** built with **Streamlit**, **LangChain**, and **Google Gemini 2.5 Flash**, designed to answer user questions using data from a **locally stored Knowledge Graph**.
It functions as a **Health & Nutrition Advisor**, reading structured and unstructured graph data to generate detailed, domain-aware responses.

---

### 🧩 Features

✅ **Knowledge Graph-based context** — Reads `graph_documents.pkl` for domain knowledge.
✅ **Gemini 2.5 Flash Integration** — Fast, cost-efficient reasoning via LangChain’s `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI`.
✅ **Streamlit UI** — User-friendly web app for instant Q&A.
✅ **Fully Local Context** — No vector DB required; operates on serialized graph documents.
✅ **Custom Prompts** — Prevents hallucination by constraining Gemini to provided context.

---

### 🏗️ Architecture

```plaintext
graph_documents.pkl  →  LangChain  →  Gemini 2.5 Flash (LLM)
                               ↓
                        Streamlit Chat UI
```

**Workflow**

1. Load serialized graph documents (`graph_documents.pkl`).
2. Combine contents into a context string.
3. Send both **context** and **user question** to Gemini via LangChain.
4. Streamlit displays the AI’s detailed answer.

### 💬 Example Interaction

**User:**

> What are the best protein sources for a vegan diet?

**Chatbot:**

> Based on the knowledge graph, top vegan protein sources include lentils, chickpeas, tofu, quinoa, and nuts.
> Combining plant proteins helps ensure a complete amino acid profile.
